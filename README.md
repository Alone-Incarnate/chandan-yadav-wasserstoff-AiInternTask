# object detection and annotation system

## overview

the object detection and description system is an innovative application that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to detect and describe objects in images. by utilizing the yolov8 model for object detection and the segformer model for segmentation, this system accurately identifies various objects within an image. additionally, it employs the groq api to generate concise and informative descriptions of the detected objects. this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface through streamlit, making it accessible for users to upload images and receive instant object analysis.

## features

- object detection: identifies multiple objects in an uploaded image using yolov8.
- segmentation: isolates detected objects for better visualization and analysis.
- description generation: provides precise, 50-word descriptions of the identified objects using the groq api.
- user-friendly interface: built with streamlit for easy interaction and visualization of results.

## setup instructions

to set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. clone the repository.
2. create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
3. activate the virtual environment.
4. install the required packages using pip.
5. set up environment variables, including your groq api key.

## usage guidelines

1. run the application by starting streamlit.
2. upload an image file (jpeg or png) that you want to analyze.
3. view the results, which will display each detected object's name, segmented image, and description.
